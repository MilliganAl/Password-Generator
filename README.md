<h1>Password-Generator</h1>

<p> A simple program demonstrating what we can do with the Random class in Java.</p>
 
<h2> How to use this program. </h2> 

<p> This program can be ran in an IDE ( inteliJ, eclipse, etc.) but works best as an executable .jar file and ran in the command line. </p>

<p> The program will ask you what the password is for, then it will ask you to enter a username for the account. Once you have done that, it will automaticly make a <i> password.txt </i> file in the project folder of the workspace. If you already have used the app, it will just add your password to the list </p>
